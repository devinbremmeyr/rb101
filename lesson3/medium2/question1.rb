=begin
Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for 
that object.

It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be 
different objects. The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular 
named-variable can change depending on what is done to that named-variable.

In other words, in Ruby everything is an object...but it is not always THE SAME
object.

Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the 
code below:
